###Scatter Plot

'''
This plot shows how candidates from both politial parties are doing on the two largest social media platforms of the day, Facebook and Twitter. 

The scatter plot shows a big discrepancy between those who have a strong social presense, and those who rely on their political platform to gain traction.

###Crosstab

'''
This crosstab demonstrates the distribution of total victims based of the perpetratorsâ€™ races through the years from 1982 to 2015. The color indicates the percentage of victims that became fatalities. An observation that can be made is the slow increase in other races presence in these visualizations in contrast to the predominant white perpetrators.

We found interesting that how this correlates with the decrease in prejudice in minorities groups, and the increase diversity of the perpetrators shootings.

###Bar Chart
'''
This barchart displays each incident per year since 1982. Each bar is labeled with the fatality rate for the specific incident and is colored based on the Fatality KPI which relates each incident to a Low Fatality rate, a Medium Fatality rate, or a High Fatality rate.The barchart also displays a reference line that is placed at the average fatality rate for all incidents. This barchart is interesting because it depicts and compares the severity of each incident. This barchart tells us that in the most recent years (since 2009),the amount of incidents with an above average fatality rate has been greater than the incidents from 1982-2009.
